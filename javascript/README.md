We provide two demos:

1.  hmsanalyticskitdemo: this is a completed code for the sample app
2.  hmsanalyticskitdemo-start: this is a starting code that you'll build upon during this codelab.


You can switch to the hmsanalyticskitdemo directory, use the command `npm install` to install the dependencies, then run command `npm run dev` to run the project directly.

You should create an app in AppGallery Connect, and obtain the project configuration then copy to your web project.[Development Process](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/javascript-dev-process-0000001051145662).
