HmsAnalyticsKitDemo demonstrates how to use the Analytics SDK for quick games.

1. Download HmsAnalyticsKitDemo by cloning this repository or downloading the compressed package. 

2. Open Cocos Dashboard, import the project, and configure the project development environment.

    1. On the **Editor** page, download Cocos Creator of the required version.

    2. On the **Project** page, click **Add** and select the required HmsAnalyticsKitDemo project.

    3. Open the imported project.

    4. Go to **File** > **Settings...** and set **Data Editor** and **Native Develop**.

        1. On the **Data Editor** page, set **External Script Editor** to the path of Visual Studio Code.

        2. On the **Native Develop** page, set **NDK Root** to the NDK path.

        3. On the **Native Develop** page, set **Android SDK Root** to the path of the Android SDK.

3. Download the Analytics SDK and import it to **assets/Lib**.

    1. Import the SDK file, which is named [hmscore-analytics-sdk-quickgame-*xx.xx.xx*.esm.js](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Library/quickapp-sdk-download-0000001090739375). In the **Set as a plug-in** dialog box displayed, select **Yes**.

    2. Import the AppGallery Connect file on which the Analytics SDK depends, which is named [agconnect-quickgame-*xx.xx.xx*-min.js](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Library/agc-auth-quickgame-sdkdownload-0000001182308451). In the **Set as a plug-in** dialog box displayed, select **Yes**.

4. Build and run the project.

    1. Start HUAWEI Quick App IDE, create a project, and click **compilation** to debug the project. During the debug, install Huawei Quick App Loader on your phone, and then go back to Cocos Dashboard.

    2. Go to **Project** > **Build...**.

    3. In the **Build...** dialog box displayed, set **Platform** to **Huawei Quick Game** and click **Build**. After the build is complete, click **Play**.

    4. In the **QuickGame Devtools** dialog box displayed, click â–¶ to run the project.

    5. (Optional) Go to the **OUTPUT** panel of HUAWEI Quick App IDE to view the log information.

Apart from the preceding operations, you need to create an app in AppGallery Connect, obtain the **agconnect-services.json** file, and assign the JSON data in the file to the **aGConnectServicesConfig** variable in the **Analytics.js** file. Click [here](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/introduction-0000001050745149) to learn more about the development process.

## Installation

Use HUAWEI Quick Game IDE to open the compressed project, which contains two demos:
